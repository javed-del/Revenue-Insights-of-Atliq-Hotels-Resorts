Explore my data-driven journey into the world of hospitality with the "AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights" project. Partnering with AtliQ Grands, a distinguished name in luxury and business hotels, we embarked on a mission to rejuvenate market share and revenue growth.

This project leveraged the power of data analytics, centered around Power BI, to unlock key insights. My toolkit included MS Excel, Power BI Service, DAX, and more. The goal? To decode critical hotel industry metrics like ADR, RevPAR, and occupancy rates.

My meticulously structured dataset, consisting of dimensions and fact files, formed the backbone of our analysis. The result? An interactive dashboard that visually presents these insights, making data-driven decisions accessible and intuitive.

Among our key findings are a stable Average Daily Rate (ADR), a robust 57% occupancy rate, and an impressive guest satisfaction rating of 3.62.
